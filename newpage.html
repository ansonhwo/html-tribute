          Summary
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Donald John Trump</strong> (born June 14, 1946) is an American businessman,
          reality television personality, politician, and President-elect of the United States.
          Since 1971 he has chaired The Trump Organization, the principal holding company
          for his real estate ventures and other business interests. During his business career,
          Trump has built office towers, hotels, casinos, golf courses, and other branded
          facilities worldwide. He was elected as the 45th U.S. president in the 2016 election
          on the Republican ticket, defeating Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and is scheduled
          to take office on January 20, 2017.

          Trump, Up and Coming
        </p>
        <p>
          Trump was born and raised in New York City and received a bachelor's degree in economics
          from the <em>Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania</em> in 1968. In 1971, he took
          control of his father Fred Trump's real estate and construction firm. Trump has appeared
          at the Miss USA pageants, which he owned from 1996 to 2015, and has made cameo appearances
          in films and television series. He sought the Reform Party presidential nomination in 2000,
          but withdrew before voting began.

          From Businessman to President
        </p>
        <p>
          In June 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for president as a Republican and quickly emerged
          as the front-runner for his party's nomination. In May 2016, his remaining Republic rivals
          suspended their campaigns, and in July he was formally nominated for president at the 2016
          Republican National Convention. Trump's campaign received unprecedented media coverage and
          international attention. Many of his statements in interviews, on Twitter, and at campaign
          rallies have been controversial or false. Several rallies during the primaries were
          accompanied by protests.
