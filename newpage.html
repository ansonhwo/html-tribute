        <strong>Donald John Trump</strong> (born June 14, 1946) is an American businessman,
        reality television personality, politician, and President-elect of the United States.
        Since 1971 he has chaired The Trump Organization, the principal holding company
        for his real estate ventures and other business interests. During his business career,
        Trump has built office towers, hotels, casinos, golf courses, and other branded
        facilities worldwide. He was elected as the 45th U.S. president in the 2016 election
        on the Republican ticket, defeating Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and is scheduled
        to take office on January 20, 2017.

        Trump was born and raised in New York City and received a bachelor's degree in economics
        from the <em>Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania</em> in 1968. In 1971, he took
        control of his father Fred Trump's real estate and construction firm. Trump has appeared
        at the Miss USA pageants, which he owned from 1996 to 2015, and has made cameo appearances
        in films and television series. He sought the Reform Party presidential nomination in 2000,
        but withdrew before voting began. He hosted and co-produced <em>The Apprentice</em>, a reality
        television series on NBC, from 2004 to 2015.

        In June 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for president as a Republican and quickly emerged
        as the front-runner for his party's nomination. In May 2016, his remaining Republic rivals
        suspended their campaigns, and in July he was formally nominated for president at the 2016
        Republican National Convention. Trump's campaign received unprecedented media coverage and
        international attention. Many of his statements in interviews, on Twitter, and at campaign
        rallies have been controversial or false. Several rallies during the primaries were
        accompanied by protests.
